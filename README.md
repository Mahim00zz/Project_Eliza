# Project_Eliza
Introducing project ELIZA a chatbot made with java that produces prompt and response based on string manipulation.

In this project, Eliza is produced on the basis of string manipulation. Using the prompt bank we store, gather, question and release a statement. All of this is randomized to make sure to keep the user interested. I hope you like it and play around with it.
